							What are Databases?
						</h3>
						<p>
							A structured set of data
						</p>
						<p>
							Databases are a collection of information, they are used
							 for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are
							 many different types of databases and they can be classified
							 in a basic approach of relational database or non-relational
							 database. Relationships means a set of our data is related to
							 another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational
							 database there is not a common related section of our data.
							 Our databases are put into sections of data called schemas,
							 inside each schema each data set is organized into tables,
							 those tables contain columns and rows to house that piticular
							 set of data.

								Storage

							<p>
								All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is
								housed on your harddrive, often times large companies will
								have floors upon floors of just database storage (think
								NSA styled). Our computer stores informaiton on the harddrive,
								we are able to create new informaiton, read informaiotn,
								update information and delete inforation.

								Searching

							<img src="images/database-search.jpg" alt="Searching">
							<p>
								Since there could potentially be a lot of information a
								database stores one, problem we might run into is finding
								the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full
								of books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo
								Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book,
								checking the title and moving onto the next until you find
								it. That's very slow as most libraries discovered. Instead
								if we were to ID each itm we can find it quickly.

							<p>
								The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a
								storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well if only
								one user had access to that data its just like what we have
								built into our own computers, it wouldn't be useful to
								others users. However, the joy of having a database is that
								it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating,
								reading, updating and deleting information that all users
								would see.

							<p>
								There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the
								storing of information. As Big Data has erupted so too have
								the size and amount of companies on the market. That being
								said, a lot of their software is free for most users, think
								of MySQL, which while being a incredible DB is completely
								free of cost and is used by a large company called Facebook.
